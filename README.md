# Big-Data-Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-GBP-USD-Exchange-Rates
1.1. Project Background and Motivation
We are all know the foreign exchange (forex) market is very important to our economy, famous by its vast liquidity and dynamic nature. It is one of the most critical financial markets globally (Hull, 2018). I chose the GBPUSD pair for in-depth analysis in this project because it has a rich history and is the oldest actively traded currency on the forex market(IG. "What Are the Top 10 Most Traded Currencies in the World?,https://www.tastyfx.com/news/what-are-the-top-10-most-traded-currencies-in-the-world-200115/). It represents the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, two economically significant currencies. Additionally, examining major currency pairs can help uncover correlations within the global economy, which further piqued my curiosity. In this project, historical datas of 4 main currency pairs will be downloaded and analysed using big data techniques with distributed processing tools such as Hadoop HDFS, Spark, and Spark MLlib, with PySpark serving as the primary programming environment(Zaharia et al., 2016).

The motivation for this study light up after reading the analysis from JP Morgan Chase paper about Market outlook 2025: Navigating cross-currents, it give me an idea of forecasts for major currency pairs. I was passionate about how can I apply my big data technique to predict the market price on the big time series data, that I can distributed storage with HDFS and processing it using Spark DataFrames in Spark Machine Learning library -which is different from the Pandas environment. By developing predictive models that forecast future currency movements, I aim to gain valuable insights into both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. Ultimately, this study give us all different view of forex market behavior, volatility, and trend dynamics while challenging myself to apply cutting-edge big data methodologies in financial forecasting.

1.2 Objectives, Dataset, Hypotheses, and Research Questions
The primary objective of this project is to leverage big data technologies to analyze historical currency exchange rate data collect from Yahoo Finance and to develop predictive models that forecast future price movements. Some keys study are to understand the typical behavior and volatility of GBPUSD by calculating daily changes and identifying periods of unusual market activity, and predicting using baseline model such as simple moving average, bolinger Band and try with more advange model as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and regression techniques that incorporate lag features that work with Spark Machine Learning Library. Minimise the use of Pandas DataFrame, leverage the use of RDD and Spark dataFrame to ensure scalability and efficiency in data processing. Examine the relationships between GBPUSD and key macroeconomic indicators like GDP, inflation, and unemployment from 3 of the 5 core ereas (the five factors that tend to affect all currencies the greatest include monetary policy, price inflation, confidence and sentiment, economic growth (GDP), and the balance of payments)(https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/five-reports-affect-the-pound.asp). -by integrating these data sources, to master of storage data in Hadoop, again combine the macroeconomic indicators data with the currency data to have in-deep understand the correlation between all factors to the price movement.

There are some research questions that I want to answer in this project:

How do exchange rate trends evolve over time across these currencies?
Are there significant correlations or patterns between specific currency pairs?
Can machine learning models forecast future currency trends given historical data?
Hypotheses:

Trend Analysis: Exchange rates for these currencies exhibit distinct trends during periods of economic instability.
Correlation Analysis: Certain currency pairs (e.g., AUD, CAD, NZD—often influenced by commodity prices) show higher correlation during market stress.
Predictive Modeling: Using Spark MLlib, time series forecasting models can predict short-term fluctuations with reasonable accuracy.
Empirical tasks will be how the data being fetch from yahoo finance and World Bank Open Data(wbdata), clean it and preprocess it using PySpark.Then when the data is ready some Exploratory analysis and visualization of time-series data will be imply. leverage it with some statisctial testing and finally build and eveluate each forecasting models using Spark MLlib.

1.3. Relevance of Forex Analysis in Big Data
This study is clearly relevant from both academic and practical perspectives. Academically, I can demonstrate what I have learn about Big Data Analysis, how to use hadoop to process large datasets aligns with contemporary trends in data science , how to distributed storage data in HDFS, how I can interact, process the data with Spark DataFrames, how can I get myself familiar with using Spark ML Lib for predicting model.

Practically, the insights derived from this analysis can inform trading strategies, risk management, and policy-making. By understanding the nuances of GBPUSD behavior—whether through identifying periods of high volatility, linking price movements to macroeconomic events, or accurately forecasting future prices—traders and analysts are better positioned to make informed decisions in a fast-paced market. The methodology and findings from this study can also be adapted to other currency pairs or financial instruments, underscoring the broader impact and applicability of the work.

In summary, this project not only meets the technical and methodological requirements of a big data analysis course but also contributes meaningful insights into forex market dynamics, ultimately bridging the gap between data-driven research and real-world financial applications.

1.4. Planned Analysis & Business Application, Technologies Used
The dataset contains historical exchange rate data of the 7 pairs EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, NZD, JPY, CHF versus USD from 2 sources Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage because they aggregate data from different liquidity providers, banks, or exchanges and time zone different, and they have some data that the other don't. Another dataset is macroeconomic indicators from World Bank; it will be processed using PySpark on a distributed cluster to handle the large-scale data efficiently. The process will load forex and macroeconomic dataset into HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), ensuring scalability. Step by step data transformation will include handling missing values, aligning time zones, and aggregating data at different time intervals (daily, weekly, and monthly). Beside that, I will calculate summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and volatility measures for each currency pair. The data will be stored and processed in Spark DataFrames and RDDs, I want to minimise the use of Pandas to ensure optimized performance on distributed infrastructure, however, something like plot the data with Matplotlib I have to convert the data to pandas dataFrame because PySpark DataFrame does not support native plotting, It optimised for distributed computing and unfortunately does not have built-in support for visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn.

A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be processed to uncover patterns and relationships within the exchange rate data. I will create Time-series visualizations to analyze trends and seasonality in GBP/USD movements over time. Some indicators will be computed such as Moving averages, Bollinger Bands, and volatility measures to identify periods of market instability. The important role of EDA is correlation analysis between different currency pairs (e.g., GBP/USD vs. EUR/USD or AUD/USD vs. CAD/USD) to understand their interdependencies. Moreover, I will test the influence of macroeconomic indicators (GDP, inflation, unemployment) on GBP/USD movements using statistical correlation tests.

I developed and deployed some forecasting models using Spark MLlib, leveraging the parallel processing power of PySpark. I will explore both traditional time-series models such as Simple Moving Average, Bollinger Bands and more advanced models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-mean Clustering. More importantly, I will compute the feature engineering to improve model performance, including creating lag features, rolling averages, and integrating macroeconomic indicators into the predictive framework. Then the models will be trained and validated using distributed cross-validation techniques, ensuring robustness. I will evaluate the model performance based on metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to determine the best approach for forecasting future exchange rate movements.

The key findings from this project will apply in businesses and the finance sector particularly in risk management, international trade, and forex hedging strategies. The benefit of accurately forecasting exchange rates can help financial institutions, multinational corporations, and forex traders optimize their hedging strategies, reduce currency exposure risks, and make informed trading decisions. The combination of forex data and macroeconomic insights will give us a holistic view of the market, helping businesses in planning capital flows, managing inflation risks, and enhancing investment decisions in foreign currencies. Finally, this project will contribute to data-driven decision-making in financial markets by leveraging big data analytics and machine learning techniques using Pyspark.
